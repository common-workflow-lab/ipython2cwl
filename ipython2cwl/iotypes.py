Basic Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each variable can be an input or an output. The basic data types are:

* Inputs:

  * CWLFilePathInput

  * CWLBooleanInput

  * CWLStringInput

  * CWLIntInput

  * CWLFloatInput

* Outputs:

  * CWLFilePathOutput

  * CWLDumpableFile

  * CWLDumpableBinaryFile


Complex Dumpables Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dumpables are variables which are able to be written to a file, but the jupyter notebook developer
does not want to write it, for example to avoid the IO overhead. To bypass that, you can use
Dumpables annotation. See :func:`~ipython2cwl.iotypes.CWLDumpable.dump` for more details.
